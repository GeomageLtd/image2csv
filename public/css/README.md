# CSS Architecture - Image2CSV Application

## Overview
The styles have been refactored from a single 2024-line `styles.css` file into 6 focused, modular CSS files for better maintainability and organization.

## File Structure

```
📁 public/css/
├── base.css       - Reset, typography, core layout (103 lines)
├── forms.css      - Form elements, inputs, buttons (342 lines)
├── gallery.css    - Image gallery, previews, viewer (650 lines)
├── table.css      - CSV tables, editing, validation (850 lines)
├── modals.css     - Crop modal and other modals (380 lines)
└── responsive.css - Mobile and responsive styles (520 lines)

📄 public/styles.css - Main entry point with @import statements
```

## Module Descriptions

## Import Order
The main `styles.css` imports modules in dependency order:
1. `base.css` - Foundation styles
2. `forms.css` - Form components
3. `gallery.css` - Image components
4. `table.css` - Table components  
5. `modals.css` - Modal overlays
6. `responsive.css` - Responsive overrides

## Benefits

### Maintainability
- Each file focuses on a specific feature area
- Easier to locate and modify specific styles
- Reduced cognitive overhead when making changes

### Team Development
- Multiple developers can work on different modules
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Clear ownership and responsibility areas

### Performance
- Potential for lazy loading specific modules
- Better browser caching strategies
- Easier to identify unused styles

### Code Quality
- Better organization promotes cleaner code
- Easier to spot style duplication
- Encourages component-based thinking

## Usage

The application automatically loads all styles through the main `styles.css` file. No changes are needed to the HTML or JavaScript - the refactoring is purely organizational.

## Migration Notes

All original functionality is preserved. The refactoring was done by:
1. Analyzing the original 2024-line file for logical groupings
2. Extracting related styles into focused modules
3. Preserving all CSS selectors and properties exactly
4. Maintaining the cascade order through import sequence
5. Adding clear documentation and organization
